# CoPilot and it's integration into a business

Each driver can set their own profile with the truck they are driving, registration number and daily, weekly or monthly reports sent directly through the company through CoPilot.
CoPilot focuses on the streamlining, fastforawrding and organising drivers in a business while also focusing as being a genuine co-pilot to drivers. 
A special MapKit using Apple Maps is used in order to make sure the routes are as helpful as possible.
